Wake up, wake up!
Make it a Mickey morning (Mickey morning!)
Wake up, wake up!
Make it a Mickey morning

Jumpin' outta bed (yeah!)
It's a wonderful day (uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, oh-oh)
So many things to do to make the day go great (you can do it!)

Stretch your arms, brush your teeth, get dressed in your own style
Eat your breakfast, put on your shoes
Ready, set, now don't forget to do a little dance and smile!

Wake up, wake up!
Make it a Mickey morning (Mickey morning!)
Wake up, wake up!
Make it a Mickey morning

La-la, la-la
La, la, la-la-la, la-la (Mickey morning!)
La-la, la-la (haha)
La, la, la-la-la, la-la

Every morning's one more chance
To start the day afresh (with me!)
That's right (whoa-hoh!)

Wake up, wake up!
Make it a Mickey morning (Mickey morning!)
Wake up, wake up!
Make it a Mickey morning

La-la, la-la (yeah!)
La, la, la-la-la, la-la (Mickey morning!)
La-la, la-la (haha)
La, la, la-la-la, la-la

Let's go!
