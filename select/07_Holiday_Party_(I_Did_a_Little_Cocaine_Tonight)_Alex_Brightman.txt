Hope to see you at our holiday party, Joe.
Holiday party? God, no.
Hark the herald angels sing
Glory to the newborn king
Peace on earth and mercy mild
God and sinners reconciled
If I'm being honest it was all very harrowing
When the invite came for an evening of caroling
I don't like singing
I'm not much for conversation
And the combo of the two gave me such hesitation
I took a little something just to dull all the edges
Either that or I was certain to be jumping off the ledges
I'm really quite sorry but I'm going to admit it
I'm really so sorry, If I could I would quit it
But the fact of the matter is I did a little cocaine tonight
God rest ye Merry Gentlemen, let nothing you dismay
Remember, Christ our savior was born on Christmas Day
I'm trying to relax but instead I keep finding
That I'm sweating from my brow and my teeth won't stop grinding
And my mouth was as dry as the sand of the Sahar-y
So I miscalculated and I chugged down a sherry
The whole room is spinning and I want to take a knee
But instead I'll sneak a bump as I hide behind the tree
I'm really very sorry that I can't stop talking
I'm so very sorry for my chirping and my squawking
But the fact of the matter is I did a little cocaine tonight
O come all ye faithful
Joyful and triumph
Things started real and they kept getting realer
I started running low, so I called up my dealer
Twenty minutes later the apartment door was buzzin'
When my dealer came in I said he was my cousin
I didn't think it through and I realized I'd been reckless
Cause my dealer is a stealer and he left with a necklace
I truly am regretting that I did a little cocaine tonight
Oh, man, here comes Ann
She's the athlete from 12 G
She's the knees of the bees
Always makin' eyes at me
It would seem such a dream if I asked her for a dance
But I just blew a rail and I'm gonna shit my pants
Hey Ann, I'm Joe Hey there, Joe
But of course, you know Yes Joe, I know
I don't know why I'm telling you so I was just about to go
I just got here and grabbed a beer I'm partied out without a doubt
Are people singing or is it clear
When it comes to singing I can do without
You look stunning - is your nose running? Truth be told, I have a cold
I can get a tissue,
if it's an issue Oh hell, I'm lying, there's no denying
If I come clean, don't start a scene
But in this moonlight, you're such a sight
That it just feels right to admit I
did a little bit of cocaine tonight
Do you have more?
I can get some.
